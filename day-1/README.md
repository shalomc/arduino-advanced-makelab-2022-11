# Remarks on the included code
## ToggleButton and ToggleButton2
These sketches toggle a switch state between on and off. Each click will change the state. 
These 2 sketches are almost identical. To toggle the switch state, `ToggleButton` uses a line
    is_turned_on = !is_turned_on; // flip button
